# Guessing-Numbers
My aim is to make an ai that can find out what happend to a number.
So its my first time using github. I dont know if anyone will see this.

I made a script called making Numbers.py
    This Script makes numbers and puts them into Numbers.csv
 


Now i want an ai to read these Numbers. And then find a patterns. I want the Ai to understand what happend to 3 that it ended up 38, What happend to 6 that it ended up 41... and so on.

I tried for a few hours and could not get anywhere. If someone could direct me into the right direction, that would be amazing. :)
